## Introduction: Modestly..

My thoughts and ideas are hard to gather sometimes, and even so I still try. Ever shall I find a way for my words to find their way, so I ask myself.
I decided to make a blog, or a "Blog" in this case, as I have no real idea of how this is supposed to pan-out. How should I show the things I do? How should I learn something new? How should I communicate the way I think about topics? I don't know. Do I have to do this? No.. Not really. I like the idea, I want to express myself, I want catharsis. I'm not sure I'll find it typing, but thinking leads someplace, and I want to talk about my happy place.

## Tech! This is what this should be about.

Sure, it should. It might. I'll consider the ramifications as I go.

## For now, making small things.

I've been working in some projects these past months, not as much as I've been wanting to, but enough to satisfy my dwindling curiosity. Yes! Dwindling. Work, family, friends! "friends", and a bag of other things could cause that. Maybe it's because I'm really anxious - really, really anxious - that I tend to have a hard time to do some things, burnout is usually something that I have to think a lot about, without it generating a burnout by itself, which is not a simple task in itself but it can be slowly burning you.
I want to retake some projects - I want to learn Python, more in-depth C, I want to learn Cybersecurity, Chinese, Swedish, and a list of things that I can't think of at this point, but will surely remember later today - I want to use my time to make these things happen, stop the procastination, stop feeling so exhausted sometimes.

I have no clue, but I'll update here.

Kind regards and thanks,
Leon.
